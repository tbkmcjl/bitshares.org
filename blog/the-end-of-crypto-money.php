  <h2>The End of Cryptomoney </h2>
  <p>
  2014-03-25 the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued its 
  long-awaited Guidance on how to categorize cryptocurrencies for 
  tax reporting in the USA. The reactions were more or less what one
  would have expected: libertarians yowled like betrayed cats, 
  accountants breathed sighs of relief with only three weeks to go
  until this year's filing deadline for personal taxes (pity about 
  the corporate deadline just missed, but that's what extensions are
  for), and Bitcoin supporters cried foul.
  </p>

  <p>
  Lost in the din of responses was the relatively quiet and fast growing 
  Distributed Autonomous Company (DAC) community, for whom the Guidance
  was a mixed bag. On the one hand, well... taxes. On the other hand, it
  made complete sense.
  </p>

  <p>
  As supremely ironic as this decision should be to those who know him, 
  this provides perverse vindication for BitShares founder, Daniel Larimer,
  who coined the phrase Distributed Autonomous Company to describe systems
  like Bitcoin, and who has argued all along that the units issued by a 
  distributed, token-issuing blockchain management system (cryptocurrency) 
  are more accurately viewed as shares, and not as coins. It also provides 
  vindication for his position in favor of Proof of Stake (POS) over Proof 
  of Work (POW) as the means of confirming transactions and securing the 
  network.
  </p>

  <p>
  Since the 2013-03-18 FinCEN Guidance on Virtual Currency, accounting and
  finance professionals have wondered what the ultimate fate of 'miners' 
  would be. Should they pay taxes on their gains only when liquidated or used
  to purchase goods and services, or should they pay taxes on the value of the
  bitcoins at the moment that they are 'mined' and pay either income or 
  capital gains taxes later, depending on how long the bitcoins were held
  before changing hands and on whether their value had risen or fallen in 
  the meantime? Intelligent individuals have made impassioned arguments 
  supporting both views.
  </p>


  <p>
  By declaring bitcoins to be property, and not currency, IRS officials have 
  put cryptocurrencies into the Barter 'regulatory bucket', the rules of which
  are well defined in statutes and regulations. If they had opted instead for 
  currency, as Bitcoin supporters had hoped, this would have been the first 
  time that a privately minted, unbacked medium of exchange issued by an
  autonomous software network—with no corporate sponsor or responsible 
  individual—had been recognized as being in the same category as a national
  currency... except that this 'nation' is a world-spanning nomadic disapora 
  with no homeland. In all fairness, that is a lot to ask; it's so much easier
  to lump bitcoins together with comic books, collectable stamps, and Magic: 
  The Gathering playing cards.
  </p>

  <p>
  If history is any guide, Finance Ministers around the world are likely to 
  follow their US counterpart's lead and treat bitcoins the same way that one 
  would treat anything that one acquires in the expectation of liquidating it
  at a gain later; in other words: assets.
  </p>

  <p>
  Intriguingly, this episode fits Richard Rahn's 1999 prediction in The End
  of Money:In the future, trade will be executed by instantaneous and 
  simultaneous debiting and crediting liquid wealth accounts, held by both
  banking and non-banking institutions. The new electronic digital payments
  technology will enable property rights claims on real assets, such as
  stock and bond funds, or gold, to be utilitzed as the medium of exchange
  for virtually all transactions. (p.33)
  </p>

  <p>
  As Larimer has pointed out on many occasions, the units issued by Bitcoin
  and all other cryptocurrency systems more intuitively resemble shares in 
  startups with small capitalizations than legal tender of sovereign nations.
  </p>

  <p>
  When seen in terms of shares rather than coins the tokens that a 
  cryptocurrency system issues beg for closer scrutiny. In particular, 
  note who in the Bitcoin system holds the voting power: the transaction 
  processors, known metaphorically as 'miners'. The holders of bitcoins 
  are passive participants who have no voting power. Seen as a company, 
  the holders of bitcoin-the-unit own non-voting capital shares. The
  miners, who might or might not hold bitcoins, have all of the voting 
  power. This is a necessary consequence of Bitcoin's reliance on POW.
  </p>

  <p>
  One way of getting around this problem is to use POS, which secures a 
  system by having the 'shareholders' vote on the valid transaction ledger
  in proportion to their holdings. In this way, those who own the system 
  secure the system without having to spend huge amounts of resources 
  on doing more work than any attacker can. POS is directly analogous 
  to conventional one-vote-per-share corporate governance.
  </p>

  <p>
  Granted, Bitcoin developers could replace POW with POS, but they would 
  need the cooperation of the miners, as they control the majority of 
  the computing power that makes up the Bitcoin system, even if they 
  choose not to hold bitcoins. This would be asking them to kill the 
  goose that lays the cryptocurrency eggs.
  </p>

  <p>
  This corporate governance structure is unusual in countries that tend
  to attract a lot of foreign investment, like Australia, Canada, the 
  UK, and the USA. It is much more like the large, family-owned combines
  that one sees in the Developing World.
  </p>

  <p>
  Carrying the company analogy a bit further, the goal of maximizing the 
  'equity-value-per-share' ratio replaces the goal of maintaining a 
  constant 'purchasing-power-per-unit' ratio in a currency system. With 
  a currency, the general tendency is to strive for a stable 
  price-per-stuff ratio. Shares, on the other hand, are expected to pay
  dividends, appreciate in value, or both. When we think of a DAC as a 
  company, rather than as a mint, the idea of units that increase in 
  value comes more naturally.
  </p>

  <p>
  When we think of cryptocurrency units as shares in the DACs that issue
  them, we can think of our holdings as Rahn's "liquid wealth accounts" 
  from which we spend, e.g., $X worth of bitcoins, rather than Y bitcoins.
  In this way, the cryptocurrency acts as a medium of exchange and store 
  of value, but not as a unit of account or measure of value... just like
  transferable shares in an investment portfolio... rather like buying 
  goods and services with shares from one's investment portfolio.
  </p>


  <p>
  Of course, True Scotsmen will persist in describing cryptocurrencies as
  currency, but now that the IRS has instructed US users to think of them
  as property, clinging to this One True analogy and railing against those 
  who foresake it is as useful in practical, day-to-day business as an
  Englishman in New York insisting on driving on the 'proper' side of the
  street and railing against the bloody colonials who all drive on the wrong side of the street.
